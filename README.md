## What is OpenACP?

OpenACP is a self-hosted bridge that connects AI coding agents to your messaging platforms. You chat with an AI agent through Telegram, Discord, or Slack — it reads your codebase, writes code, runs commands, and streams results back to you in real time.

Built on the open [Agent Client Protocol (ACP)](https://agentclientprotocol.org/). Your machine, your keys, your data.

```
You (Telegram / Discord / Slack)
  ↓
OpenACP (bridge + session manager)
  ↓
AI Agent (Claude Code, Codex, Gemini, Cursor, ...)
  ↓
Your Codebase
```

## Why OpenACP?

| Without OpenACP | With OpenACP |
|----------------|-------------|
| *"Its usage is currently focused on its dedicated terminal REPL and specific IDE integrations"* | Control from Telegram, Discord, or Slack — any device, anywhere |
| *"Codex Desktop App only works with local projects. It does not support development on remote hosts"* | Full remote development support — run agents on your server, manage from your phone |
| *"There's no way to trigger Claude Code sessions from external issue trackers"* | REST API for CI/CD integration and external triggers |
| *"Being able to use a proper mobile app UI would be much better than having to access sessions through ssh + tmux"* | Native Telegram/Discord UI — no SSH, no terminal on mobile |
| *"Cline is really burning up OpenRouter tokens and my wallet"* | Built-in usage tracking and monthly budget limits per session |

## Use Cases

- **Remote coding** — Tired of being chained to your desk to run Claude Code? Review PRs, fix bugs, and deploy from your phone via Telegram while away from your desk.
- **Team visibility** — Share a Discord channel where everyone sees what the AI agent is doing in real time — no more black-box coding sessions.
- **Multi-agent workflows** — Start with Claude Code for planning, switch to Codex for implementation, use Gemini for review — all in one chat thread, no reconfiguration.
- **CI/CD integration** — Trigger agent sessions from GitHub Actions or any issue tracker via the REST API.
- **Self-hosted AI gateway** — Keep API keys and code on your own infrastructure. No third-party cloud, no vendor lock-in.
- **Local LLM support** — Run agents against self-hosted models (Ollama, LM Studio) via ACP-compatible adapters. Your models, your data.

## Quick Start

```bash
npm install -g @openacp/cli
openacp
# → Interactive setup wizard starts:
# → ? Choose your platform: Telegram / Discord / Slack
# → ? Enter your bot token: ********
# → ? Select workspace directory: ~/projects
# → ? Choose default AI agent: Claude Code
# → ✓ Configuration saved. Starting OpenACP...
# → 🚀 OpenACP is running. Send a message to your bot!
```

The interactive setup wizard walks you through everything:

1. Choose your platform (Telegram, Discord, Slack, or multiple)
2. Connect your bot (token validation + auto-detection)
3. Pick a workspace directory
4. Select your default AI agent
5. Choose run mode (foreground or daemon)

That's it. Send a message to your bot and start coding.

## Known Limitations

- **Early stage** — OpenACP is under active development; expect breaking changes between minor versions
- **Single user** — Currently designed for individual use; multi-user/team support is planned
- **Remote host** — Agents run on the same machine as OpenACP; to use on a remote server, install OpenACP on that server
- **Agent availability** — Some agents require their own API keys and local installation
- **Platform features** — Not all messaging platform features are supported equally (e.g., Slack threads vs Telegram forum topics)
- **No Windows daemon** — Daemon mode (auto-start on boot) currently supports macOS and Linux only

## FAQ

### Why use Telegram or Discord instead of just the terminal?
Most AI coding agents are locked to a terminal REPL or IDE. OpenACP lets you send messages, review code diffs, approve or deny actions, and monitor progress from any device — phone, tablet, or browser — without opening a laptop.

### How is OpenACP different from MCP?
MCP (Model Context Protocol) is a standard for giving AI models access to tools and data sources. OpenACP uses the **Agent Client Protocol (ACP)** to manage full coding agent *sessions* — starting agents, streaming output, handling permissions, and routing results to your messaging platform. The two protocols are complementary: your agents can use MCP tools while OpenACP manages the session layer.

### Can I auto-approve agent actions?
Yes. By default, OpenACP shows a permission button for destructive actions. You can configure [auto-approve rules](https://openacp.gitbook.io/docs/using-openacp) to skip confirmation for specific action types (e.g., read-only operations) while still requiring approval for file writes or shell commands.

### How do I control API spending?
Set a monthly budget limit in your config. OpenACP tracks token usage and cost in real time and will pause the agent when the limit is reached. Run `openacp config` to set limits per session.

### Can I use a local or self-hosted LLM?
Yes, if the model has a compatible agent CLI. Any agent that implements the ACP protocol can be registered. Community adapters exist for Ollama and LM Studio — run `openacp agents` to browse available options.

### What happens if the agent gets stuck or the chat hangs?
Use `/cancel` in your chat to stop the current session. Run `openacp doctor` to check for connectivity or configuration issues. OpenACP's session persistence means you can resume with full context intact after a restart.

### Does OpenACP send my code to the cloud?
No. OpenACP runs entirely on your machine. AI agents connect directly to your chosen provider using your own API keys. Nothing is routed through OpenACP servers.

### Can I use multiple AI agents at the same time?
Each session uses one agent, but you can run multiple sessions simultaneously — one per thread/topic in your chat. Switch agents between sessions or start a new session with a different agent at any time.

### Is OpenACP free?
Yes. OpenACP is MIT-licensed and free to self-host. You only pay for the AI provider API keys you choose to use.

### How do I update OpenACP?
```bash
npm update -g @openacp/cli
```

## Security

OpenACP grants AI agents access to your filesystem and shell. Before using in production:

- Run in a sandboxed environment or container when possible
- Review agent permissions — use the built-in permission gate to approve/deny actions
- Never expose your OpenACP instance to the public internet without authentication
- Keep your bot tokens secret — rotate them if compromised
- See the [Security guide](https://openacp.gitbook.io/docs/self-hosting/security) for hardening recommendations
